## Implementation Status

### Backend ✅ Completed
- ✅ Artifact models (Artifact, EvidenceLink, ArtifactProcessingJob, UploadedFile)
- ✅ API endpoints for CRUD operations
- ✅ Bulk upload with file handling
- ✅ Async processing with Celery tasks
- ✅ PDF metadata extraction
- ✅ GitHub repository analysis
- ✅ Evidence link validation
- ✅ Comprehensive serializers

### Frontend ⚠️ Needs Integration
- ⚠️ API client methods exist but need validation
- ⚠️ Upload UI components need implementation
- ⚠️ File handling and progress tracking needed
- ⚠️ Integration with artifact store needed

### Testing ❌ Missing
- ❌ Backend unit tests need implementation
- ❌ Frontend integration tests needed
- ❌ End-to-end upload workflow testing

## Acceptance Criteria

### Core Upload Functionality
- ✅ Backend supports multiple file upload via bulk_upload_artifacts endpoint
- ✅ File size validation (max 10MB per file) implemented in serializer
- ✅ Support for PDF, DOC, DOCX file types with validation
- ✅ Evidence link validation with URL health checking
- ✅ Bulk upload supports up to 10 files simultaneously
- ⚠️ Frontend drag-and-drop interface needs implementation
- ⚠️ Upload progress indicator needs real-time status integration

### Metadata Extraction
- ✅ PDF metadata extraction implemented (title, author, pages, creation date)
- ✅ GitHub repository analysis extracts: languages, stars, forks, commits, topics
- ✅ Manual metadata form structure defined in serializers
- ✅ Technology suggestions API endpoint implemented with common taxonomy
- ✅ Artifact categorization by type: project, publication, presentation, certification
- ⚠️ Frontend forms need integration with suggestion API
- ⚠️ Real-time metadata preview needs implementation

### Validation and Processing
- ✅ Evidence link health check validates URLs return 200 status
- ✅ Async processing queue handles heavy operations (PDF parsing, GitHub API calls)
- ✅ Processing status updates available via artifact_processing_status endpoint
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling with specific messages implemented
- ✅ File validation prevents unauthorized types and oversized uploads
- ❌ Duplicate detection not yet implemented
- ⚠️ Frontend polling for processing status needs implementation

### User Experience
- [ ] Upload interface works on mobile devices (responsive design)
- [ ] Keyboard navigation support for accessibility (WCAG AA compliance)
- [ ] Success notifications with artifact count and processing status
- [ ] Retry mechanism for failed uploads with exponential backoff
- [ ] Cancel upload functionality stops in-progress operations

## Design Changes

## Current Implementation Issues Identified

### Backend Issues to Fix
1. **Missing serializer import**: `bulk_upload_artifacts` view references undefined `BulkArtifactUploadSerializer`
2. **Celery tasks not properly configured**: `process_artifact_upload.delay()` may fail if Celery not running
3. **File upload endpoint mismatch**: Frontend expects different URL structure than implemented
4. **Authentication integration**: API client upload methods need proper token handling

### Frontend Issues to Fix
1. **API client endpoint mismatch**: `uploadArtifactFiles` uses wrong URL pattern
2. **Missing bulk upload method**: No frontend method for `bulk_upload_artifacts` endpoint
3. **File processing status polling**: No implementation for tracking upload progress
4. **Artifact store integration**: Store needs proper API integration

### Integration Issues
1. **URL pattern mismatch**: Frontend `/v1/artifacts/` vs Backend `/api/v1/artifacts/`
2. **File handling**: Multipart form data handling needs verification
3. **Error handling**: Frontend error responses need proper mapping
4. **Authentication**: Token refresh during long uploads needs handling

## API Endpoints (Current Implementation)

### Artifact CRUD Operations
```typescript
GET /api/v1/artifacts/                    // List user artifacts
POST /api/v1/artifacts/                   // Create new artifact
GET /api/v1/artifacts/{id}/               // Get specific artifact
PATCH /api/v1/artifacts/{id}/             // Update artifact
DELETE /api/v1/artifacts/{id}/            // Delete artifact
```

### File Upload Operations
```typescript
POST /api/v1/artifacts/upload/            // Bulk upload with files + metadata
POST /api/v1/artifacts/upload-file/       // Single file upload
GET /api/v1/artifacts/{id}/status/        // Processing status
GET /api/v1/artifacts/suggestions/        // Technology suggestions
```

### Request/Response Formats
```typescript
// Bulk Upload Request
POST /api/v1/artifacts/upload/
Content-Type: multipart/form-data
Body:
  - files: File[]
  - metadata: JSON{
      title: string,
      description: string,
      artifact_type?: "project" | "publication" | "presentation" | "certification",
      start_date?: date,
      end_date?: date,
      technologies?: string[],
      collaborators?: string[],
      evidence_links?: {url: string, type: string, description?: string}[]
    }

Response: 202 {
  artifact_id: number,
  status: "processing",
  task_id: string,
  estimated_completion: timestamp,
  uploaded_files_count: number,
  evidence_links_count: number
}

// Status Check
GET /api/v1/artifacts/{id}/status/
Response: 200 {
  artifact_id: number,
  status: "pending" | "processing" | "completed" | "failed",
  progress_percentage: number,
  error_message?: string,
  processed_evidence_count: number,
  total_evidence_count: number,
  created_at: timestamp,
  completed_at?: timestamp
}
```

### Database Schema Updates
```sql
-- New artifact processing table
CREATE TABLE artifact_processing_jobs (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    artifact_id INTEGER REFERENCES artifacts(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'pending',
    progress_percentage INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    error_message TEXT,
    metadata_extracted JSONB DEFAULT '{}',
    evidence_validation_results JSONB DEFAULT '{}',
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    completed_at TIMESTAMP
);

-- Enhanced evidence_links table
ALTER TABLE evidence_links ADD COLUMN file_path TEXT;
ALTER TABLE evidence_links ADD COLUMN file_size INTEGER;
ALTER TABLE evidence_links ADD COLUMN mime_type VARCHAR(100);
ALTER TABLE evidence_links ADD COLUMN validation_metadata JSONB DEFAULT '{}';
```

### Frontend Components
```tsx
// Main upload component
<ArtifactUpload onUploadComplete={handleComplete} />

// Drag-and-drop zone
<DropZone
  acceptedTypes={['.pdf', '.doc', '.docx']}
  maxSize={10 * 1024 * 1024}
  onDrop={handleFileDrop}
/>

// Progress tracking
<UploadProgress
  files={uploadFiles}
  onCancel={handleCancel}
  showDetails={true}
/>

// Metadata form
<ArtifactMetadataForm

  onSubmit={handleMetadataSubmit}
  technologies={suggestedTechnologies}
/>
```

- Maximum 5 artifacts per user
- Enhanced error logging and monitoring
- Daily manual verification of upload quality

**Phase 2 (50% Users - 1 week)**
- Expand to 50% of user base
- Remove artifact count limits
- A/B test different UI variations
- Automated quality monitoring

**Phase 3 (100% Users)**
- Full rollout to all users
- Performance optimization based on learnings
- Documentation and user onboarding improvements

### Feature Flags

## Edge Cases & Risks

### Technical Edge Cases
- **Large File Handling**: 10MB PDF files with complex formatting may timeout during processing
  - *Mitigation*: Implement file streaming and progress callbacks
- **GitHub Rate Limiting**: API limits may block repository analysis during high usage
  - *Mitigation*: Implement exponential backoff and queue GitHub requests
- **Broken Evidence Links**: URLs may become inaccessible after upload
  - *Mitigation*: Periodic link validation and user notifications

### Security Risks
- **Malicious File Uploads**: Users may attempt to upload malware or inappropriate content
  - *Mitigation*: File type validation, virus scanning integration, content moderation
- **URL Injection**: Evidence links may point to malicious sites
  - *Mitigation*: URL validation, whitelist for trusted domains, user warnings

### Business Risks
- **Storage Costs**: Unlimited file uploads may lead to unexpected storage costs
  - *Mitigation*: Per-user storage quotas, file lifecycle management
- **GitHub API Costs**: High usage may exceed free tier limits
  - *Mitigation*: Rate limiting, caching of repository data, usage monitoring

### User Experience Risks
- **Upload Fatigue**: Complex upload process may discourage user adoption
  - *Mitigation*: Progressive disclosure, smart defaults, guided onboarding
- **Processing Delays**: Long processing times may frustrate users
  - *Mitigation*: Clear time expectations, background processing, email notifications
