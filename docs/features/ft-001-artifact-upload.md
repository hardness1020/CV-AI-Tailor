**File:** docs/features/ft-001-artifact-upload.md
**Owner:** Backend Team
**TECH-SPECs:** `spec-20250923-api.md`, `spec-20250923-frontend.md`, `spec-20250923-system.md`

## Acceptance Criteria

### Core Upload Functionality
- [ ] User can upload artifacts via drag-and-drop interface with visual feedback
- [ ] Support for multiple file types: PDF documents, GitHub repository links, live application URLs
- [ ] Upload progress indicator shows real-time status (0-100%)
- [ ] File size validation (max 10MB per file) with clear error messages
- [ ] Evidence link validation ensures URLs are accessible (200 response)
- [ ] Bulk upload supports up to 10 files simultaneously

### Metadata Extraction
- [ ] Automatic extraction of project metadata from PDFs (title, dates, technologies)
- [ ] GitHub repository analysis extracts: README content, primary language, commit history, collaborators
- [ ] Manual metadata form allows user to add/edit: title, description, start/end dates, technologies, collaborators
- [ ] Technology auto-suggestion based on common skills taxonomy (React, Python, AWS, etc.)
- [ ] Artifact categorization by type: project, publication, presentation, certification

### Validation and Processing
- [ ] Evidence link health check validates URLs return 200 status
- [ ] Duplicate detection prevents re-uploading same artifact (based on title + URL hash)
- [ ] Async processing queue handles heavy operations (PDF parsing, GitHub API calls)
- [ ] Processing status updates available via API polling (pending → processing → completed → failed)
- [ ] Error handling with specific messages: "URL unreachable", "File too large", "Unsupported format"

### User Experience
- [ ] Upload interface works on mobile devices (responsive design)
- [ ] Keyboard navigation support for accessibility (WCAG AA compliance)
- [ ] Success notifications with artifact count and processing status
- [ ] Retry mechanism for failed uploads with exponential backoff
- [ ] Cancel upload functionality stops in-progress operations

## Design Changes

### API Endpoints
```
POST /api/v1/artifacts
Content-Type: multipart/form-data
Body:
  - files: File[] (optional)
  - metadata: {
      title: string,
      description: string,
      start_date: date,
      end_date: date,
      technologies: string[],
      collaborators: string[],
      evidence_links: [
        {url: string, type: enum, description: string}
      ]
    }

Response: 202 {
  artifact_id: string,
  status: "processing",
  task_id: string,
  estimated_completion: timestamp
}

GET /api/v1/artifacts/{id}/status
Response: 200 {
  artifact_id: string,
  status: "pending" | "processing" | "completed" | "failed",
  progress_percentage: number,
  error_message: string,
  processed_evidence_count: number,
  total_evidence_count: number
}
```

### Database Schema Updates
```sql
-- New artifact processing table
CREATE TABLE artifact_processing_jobs (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    artifact_id INTEGER REFERENCES artifacts(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'pending',
    progress_percentage INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    error_message TEXT,
    metadata_extracted JSONB DEFAULT '{}',
    evidence_validation_results JSONB DEFAULT '{}',
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    completed_at TIMESTAMP
);

-- Enhanced evidence_links table
ALTER TABLE evidence_links ADD COLUMN file_path TEXT;
ALTER TABLE evidence_links ADD COLUMN file_size INTEGER;
ALTER TABLE evidence_links ADD COLUMN mime_type VARCHAR(100);
ALTER TABLE evidence_links ADD COLUMN validation_metadata JSONB DEFAULT '{}';
```

### Frontend Components
```tsx
// Main upload component
<ArtifactUpload onUploadComplete={handleComplete} />

// Drag-and-drop zone
<DropZone
  acceptedTypes={['.pdf', '.doc', '.docx']}
  maxSize={10 * 1024 * 1024}
  onDrop={handleFileDrop}
/>

// Progress tracking
<UploadProgress
  files={uploadFiles}
  onCancel={handleCancel}
  showDetails={true}
/>

// Metadata form
<ArtifactMetadataForm
  initialData={extractedMetadata}
  onSubmit={handleMetadataSubmit}
  technologies={suggestedTechnologies}
/>
```

## Test & Eval Plan

### Unit Tests
- [ ] File upload validation (size, type, content)
- [ ] URL validation and health checking
- [ ] Metadata extraction from various PDF formats
- [ ] GitHub API integration with mock responses
- [ ] Technology suggestion algorithm accuracy
- [ ] Duplicate detection logic

### Integration Tests
- [ ] End-to-end upload workflow: file → processing → completion
- [ ] Error handling for network failures during GitHub API calls
- [ ] Concurrent upload handling (multiple users, multiple files)
- [ ] Database transaction integrity during processing failures
- [ ] Evidence link validation with various URL types (GitHub, LinkedIn, live apps)

### Performance Tests
- [ ] Upload 10MB files within 30 seconds
- [ ] Process 100 concurrent uploads without degradation
- [ ] GitHub API integration completes within 10 seconds
- [ ] PDF parsing handles documents up to 50 pages
- [ ] Memory usage remains stable during bulk uploads

### User Acceptance Tests
- [ ] Non-technical users can successfully upload artifacts

## Telemetry & Metrics to Watch

### Application Metrics
- **Upload Success Rate**: Target ≥95% (excluding user errors)
- **Processing Time**: P95 ≤30s for artifact processing completion
- **File Upload Speed**: Target 1MB/s minimum upload throughput
- **Evidence Validation Rate**: ≥90% of provided URLs should be accessible

### Business Metrics
- **Upload Completion Rate**: % of users who complete upload after starting
- **Average Artifacts per User**: Track user engagement with platform
- **Technology Detection Accuracy**: % of auto-detected technologies accepted by users
- **Error Resolution Rate**: % of failed uploads that succeed on retry

### System Metrics
- **Queue Depth**: Celery task queue backlog (alert if >100)
- **Error Rate**: Processing failures (alert if >5%)
- **Storage Usage**: File storage growth rate and capacity planning
- **API Response Times**: Upload endpoint P95 ≤2s

### Dashboards

- Cost monitoring for file storage and GitHub API usage

## Rollout/Canary & Rollback

### Rollout Strategy
**Phase 1 (10% Beta Users - 1 week)**
- Limited to invited beta users
- Maximum 5 artifacts per user
- Enhanced error logging and monitoring
- Daily manual verification of upload quality

**Phase 2 (50% Users - 1 week)**
- Expand to 50% of user base
- Remove artifact count limits
- A/B test different UI variations
- Automated quality monitoring

**Phase 3 (100% Users)**
- Full rollout to all users
- Performance optimization based on learnings
- Documentation and user onboarding improvements

### Feature Flags
- `feature.artifact_upload.enabled` - Master switch for upload functionality

- `feature.upload.pdf_extraction` - Control PDF metadata extraction
- `feature.upload.bulk_upload` - Enable/disable multiple file uploads
- `feature.upload.mobile_optimized` - Mobile-specific optimizations

### Rollback Plan
**Immediate Rollback Triggers**:

**Rollback Steps**:
1. Disable upload feature via feature flag
2. Process existing queue items to completion
3. Notify users of temporary maintenance
4. Debug and fix issues in development environment
5. Re-enable with additional monitoring

## Edge Cases & Risks

### Technical Edge Cases
- **Large File Handling**: 10MB PDF files with complex formatting may timeout during processing
  - *Mitigation*: Implement file streaming and progress callbacks
- **GitHub Rate Limiting**: API limits may block repository analysis during high usage
  - *Mitigation*: Implement exponential backoff and queue GitHub requests
- **Broken Evidence Links**: URLs may become inaccessible after upload
  - *Mitigation*: Periodic link validation and user notifications

### Security Risks
- **Malicious File Uploads**: Users may attempt to upload malware or inappropriate content
  - *Mitigation*: File type validation, virus scanning integration, content moderation
- **URL Injection**: Evidence links may point to malicious sites
  - *Mitigation*: URL validation, whitelist for trusted domains, user warnings

### Business Risks
- **Storage Costs**: Unlimited file uploads may lead to unexpected storage costs
  - *Mitigation*: Per-user storage quotas, file lifecycle management
- **GitHub API Costs**: High usage may exceed free tier limits
  - *Mitigation*: Rate limiting, caching of repository data, usage monitoring

### User Experience Risks
- **Upload Fatigue**: Complex upload process may discourage user adoption
  - *Mitigation*: Progressive disclosure, smart defaults, guided onboarding
- **Processing Delays**: Long processing times may frustrate users
  - *Mitigation*: Clear time expectations, background processing, email notifications
