**Date:** 2024-09-24
**Status:** Accepted
**Author:** Claude Code
**Related Documents:** PRD-20250924, SPEC-20250924-SYSTEM

## Context and Problem Statement

The CV Tailor application needs to integrate Google authentication to improve user experience and reduce registration friction. We must decide between two primary approaches:

1. **OAuth Integration Approach**: Use Google OAuth 2.0 for authentication while maintaining our own user database and JWT token system
2. **Delegated Authentication Approach**: Fully delegate authentication to Google, treating Google as the primary identity provider

This decision significantly impacts system architecture, data ownership, user experience, and long-term technical flexibility.

## Decision Drivers

### Technical Considerations
- **System Integration Complexity**: How well does each approach integrate with existing Django + JWT architecture?
- **Data Control**: Level of control over user data and account lifecycle management
- **Scalability**: Ability to extend authentication to other providers (Facebook, GitHub, LinkedIn)
- **Performance**: Impact on authentication flow performance and reliability
- **Security**: Security implications of each approach

### Business Requirements
- **User Experience**: Seamless authentication flow with minimal friction
- **Feature Requirements**: Support for existing features (profile management, preferences)
- **Compliance**: GDPR, data residency, and privacy requirements
- **Vendor Lock-in**: Risk of dependency on Google services
- **Cost**: Implementation and ongoing maintenance costs

### Operational Factors
- **Development Timeline**: Implementation complexity and development time
- **Maintenance Burden**: Long-term maintenance and support requirements
- **Monitoring**: Ability to monitor and debug authentication issues
- **Backup Authentication**: Availability of alternative authentication methods

## Options Considered

### Option 1: OAuth Integration with Local User Management (Hybrid Approach)

**Description**: Implement Google OAuth 2.0 for initial authentication while maintaining local user accounts and JWT token system.

**Architecture**:
```
User → Google OAuth → Our Backend → JWT Tokens → Protected Resources
                        ↓
                   Local User Database
```

**Implementation**:
- Use `django-allauth` with Google provider
- Link Google accounts to existing User model
- Generate JWT tokens for authenticated users
- Maintain existing profile management features

**Pros**:
- ✅ **Data Ownership**: Complete control over user data and profiles
- ✅ **Feature Flexibility**: Can implement custom user features independently
- ✅ **Multi-Provider Ready**: Easy to add other OAuth providers (Facebook, GitHub)
- ✅ **Offline Capability**: Users can interact with application even if Google is unavailable
- ✅ **Gradual Migration**: Existing users can link Google accounts without disruption
- ✅ **Advanced Features**: Support for user preferences, custom fields, admin management
- ✅ **Compliance**: Full control over data handling for GDPR compliance
- ✅ **Debugging**: Complete visibility into authentication flow and user state

**Cons**:
- ❌ **Complexity**: More complex implementation requiring OAuth + local user management
- ❌ **Token Management**: Need to manage both OAuth tokens and JWT tokens
- ❌ **Sync Issues**: Potential for data inconsistency between Google profile and local data
- ❌ **Development Time**: Longer implementation timeline

**Cost**: Medium implementation cost, low ongoing costs

### Option 2: Full Delegated Authentication to Google

**Description**: Treat Google as the primary identity provider, storing minimal user data locally.

**Architecture**:
```
User → Google OAuth → Google Token Validation → Protected Resources
                            ↓
                    Minimal Local Cache
```

**Implementation**:
- Use Google Identity Platform or Firebase Auth
- Store only essential user data locally (ID, email, last access)
- Validate Google tokens for each request
- Rely on Google for profile information

**Pros**:
- ✅ **Simplicity**: Minimal authentication code to maintain
- ✅ **Security**: Google handles password security, 2FA, account recovery
- ✅ **Reliability**: Leverage Google's authentication infrastructure
- ✅ **Compliance**: Google handles many privacy and security requirements
- ✅ **Fast Implementation**: Quicker initial development

**Cons**:
- ❌ **Vendor Lock-in**: Heavy dependency on Google services
- ❌ **Limited Customization**: Cannot implement custom user features easily
- ❌ **Data Control**: Limited control over user data and account lifecycle
- ❌ **Single Point of Failure**: Application unusable if Google services are down
- ❌ **Cost Scaling**: Potential costs as user base grows
- ❌ **Feature Limitations**: Cannot implement advanced user management features
- ❌ **Migration Difficulty**: Hard to migrate existing users or switch providers later
- ❌ **Debugging Challenges**: Limited visibility into authentication issues

**Cost**: Low implementation cost, potential high ongoing costs at scale

### Option 3: Federated Identity with Custom Implementation

**Description**: Build a custom OAuth client without using established libraries like django-allauth.

**Pros**:
- ✅ **Full Control**: Complete control over authentication flow
- ✅ **Custom Features**: Can implement exactly what's needed

**Cons**:
- ❌ **Security Risks**: Higher risk of implementation vulnerabilities
- ❌ **Development Time**: Significantly longer implementation
- ❌ **Maintenance**: Complex ongoing maintenance requirements
- ❌ **Standards Compliance**: Risk of OAuth protocol violations

**Cost**: High implementation cost, high ongoing costs

## Decision

**We choose Option 1: OAuth Integration with Local User Management (Hybrid Approach)**

## Rationale

### Technical Alignment
The hybrid approach aligns best with our existing Django + JWT architecture. It allows us to leverage the mature `django-allauth` ecosystem while maintaining our established patterns for user management and API authentication.

### Business Value Maximization
This approach provides the highest business value by:
- Enabling rapid user onboarding through Google sign-in
- Maintaining full control over user experience and features
- Supporting future expansion to other authentication providers
- Preserving existing user accounts and features

### Risk Mitigation
- **Vendor Lock-in**: Minimized by maintaining local user accounts
- **Service Availability**: Application remains functional even if Google OAuth is temporarily unavailable
- **Data Control**: Complete ownership of user data for compliance requirements
- **Future Flexibility**: Can add/remove authentication providers without major architectural changes

### Implementation Pragmatism
- Leverages proven libraries (`django-allauth`) with extensive community support
- Provides clear migration path for existing users
- Allows incremental rollout and testing
- Maintains debugging capability for authentication issues

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)
- Install and configure `django-allauth` with Google provider
