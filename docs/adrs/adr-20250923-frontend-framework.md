# ADR: Choose React with TypeScript over Vue/Angular for Frontend

**File:** docs/adrs/adr-20250923-frontend-framework.md
**Status:** Draft

## Context

The CV Auto-Tailor frontend requires a modern JavaScript framework that can handle:
- Complex state management for artifacts, labels, and generation workflows
- File upload with drag-and-drop and progress tracking
- Real-time updates for document generation status
- Rich text editing and preview capabilities
- Mobile-responsive design with PWA capabilities
- Integration with REST APIs and WebSocket connections

The main candidates are React, Vue 3, and Angular. The team needs to choose a framework that balances development productivity, performance, ecosystem maturity, and long-term maintainability.

Key evaluation criteria:
- Component reusability and ecosystem
- TypeScript integration quality
- State management solutions
- Performance characteristics
- Team expertise and hiring pool
- Community support and documentation

## Decision

Adopt **React 18 with TypeScript** as the primary frontend framework, using Vite for build tooling and Zustand for state management.

Rationale:
1. **Mature Ecosystem**: Largest component library ecosystem (Material-UI, Ant Design, Headless UI) reduces custom component development
2. **TypeScript Integration**: First-class TypeScript support with excellent IDE tooling and type safety
3. **State Management**: Zustand provides simple, scalable state management without Redux complexity
4. **Performance**: React 18's concurrent features and automatic batching optimize UX for our generation workflows
5. **Hiring Advantage**: Largest talent pool for React developers reduces hiring risk
6. **PWA Support**: Excellent tooling for Progressive Web App features through Vite and Workbox

## Consequences

### Positive
+ **Rich Component Ecosystem**: Access to mature libraries for file uploads (react-dropzone), forms (react-hook-form), and UI components
+ **Excellent TypeScript Support**: Strong typing for props, state, and API responses reduces runtime errors
+ **Flexible Architecture**: Component composition model allows for modular, reusable UI elements
+ **Performance Optimizations**: React.memo, useMemo, and Suspense provide fine-grained performance control
+ **Developer Experience**: Hot reload, excellent DevTools, and extensive documentation
+ **Testing Ecosystem**: React Testing Library and Jest provide comprehensive testing capabilities

### Negative
- **Bundle Size**: React's runtime is larger than Vue, though tree-shaking minimizes impact
- **Learning Curve**: Hooks and concurrent features require understanding of React-specific patterns
- **Rapid Change**: React ecosystem evolves quickly, requiring ongoing education for best practices
- **Boilerplate**: More verbose than Vue for simple components, though TypeScript interfaces add structure

## Alternatives

### Vue 3 with Composition API
**Pros**: Smaller bundle size, gentler learning curve, excellent single-file components, good TypeScript support
**Cons**: Smaller ecosystem, fewer enterprise-grade component libraries, smaller talent pool
**Verdict**: Vue's simplicity doesn't outweigh React's ecosystem advantages for complex business applications

### Angular 15+
**Pros**: Full framework with everything included, excellent TypeScript integration, enterprise-focused
**Cons**: Steep learning curve, heavyweight for single-page applications, opinionated architecture
**Verdict**: Overkill for our use case; development velocity would be slower

### Svelte/SvelteKit
**Pros**: Compile-time optimizations, small bundle sizes, simple syntax
**Cons**: Much smaller ecosystem, limited component libraries, smaller talent pool
**Verdict**: Too risky for production application requiring extensive third-party integrations

## Rollback Plan

If React proves inadequate for performance or development velocity:

1. **Phase 1**: Optimize React application (code splitting, lazy loading, state optimization)
2. **Phase 2**: Migrate critical performance components to Vue or vanilla JS while keeping React shell
3. **Phase 3**: If full migration needed, component boundaries allow gradual replacement with chosen alternative

**Migration Strategy**: Micro-frontend architecture allows incremental migration by replacing individual features

**Trigger Criteria**:
- Bundle size >1MB gzipped after optimization
- Time to Interactive >3s on mobile devices
- Development velocity <2 features per sprint due to framework limitations

## Implementation Details

### Technology Stack
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite (faster than Webpack, excellent DX)
- **State Management**: Zustand (simpler than Redux, better than Context API for complex state)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (utility-first, consistent design system)
- **UI Components**: Radix UI (headless, accessible components)
- **Forms**: React Hook Form + Zod (performance + validation)
- **Testing**: Vitest + React Testing Library (faster than Jest)

### Architecture Patterns
- **Component Structure**: Atomic design with atoms, molecules, organisms
- **State Management**: Global state in Zustand stores, local state with useState
- **API Integration**: Custom hooks with React Query for caching and synchronization
- **Error Handling**: Error boundaries with graceful fallbacks
