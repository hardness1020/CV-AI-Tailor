# PRD: Google Authentication Integration

**Document ID:** PRD-20250924
**Date:** 2024-09-24
**Status:** Draft
**Author:** Claude Code

## Problem Statement

**Current State:** The CV Tailor application uses a traditional email/password authentication system requiring users to create and manage yet another set of credentials. This creates friction during onboarding and increases the likelihood of abandoned sign-ups.

**Business Problem:**
1. **User Acquisition Friction** - Manual registration creates barriers to entry, reducing conversion rates from visitors to active users
2. **Security Concerns** - Password-based authentication introduces security risks including weak passwords and credential reuse
3. **User Experience** - Users must remember another login credential set, leading to forgotten passwords and support requests
4. **Trust and Credibility** - Modern users expect seamless social login options; their absence signals outdated technology

## Target Users

**Primary Users:**
- **Job Seekers (Individual Contributors)** - Professionals looking to quickly create tailored CVs for job applications
- **Career Changers** - Individuals transitioning between industries who need multiple CV versions
- **Recent Graduates** - New entrants to job market seeking professional CV creation tools

**User Personas:**
- **"Busy Professional Sarah"** - Mid-career marketing manager, values speed and convenience, already uses Google for work email
- **"Recent Graduate Mike"** - Computer science grad, tech-savvy, expects modern auth flows, Gmail user
- **"Career Pivot Jennifer"** - Transitioning from teaching to tech, less technical confidence, prefers familiar login methods

## Business Objectives

**Primary Objectives:**
1. **Increase User Conversion Rate** by 25% within 3 months of deployment
2. **Reduce Time-to-First-Value** from 5 minutes (including registration) to under 2 minutes
3. **Decrease Support Tickets** related to authentication issues by 60%
4. **Improve User Experience** satisfaction scores from 7.2 to 8.5+ (10-point scale)

**Success Metrics:**
- **Conversion Rate**: % of visitors who complete registration (Target: +25%)
- **Authentication Method Adoption**: % of new users choosing Google login (Target: 70%+)
- **Session Duration**: Average time spent in application (Target: +15%)
- **Support Ticket Volume**: Authentication-related support requests (Target: -60%)
- **User Retention**: 7-day active user retention (Target: +20%)

## Functional Requirements

**Core Features:**
1. **Google OAuth Integration** - One-click sign-in using existing Google accounts
2. **Account Linking** - Ability to link Google account to existing email/password accounts
3. **Seamless Profile Creation** - Auto-populate user profile with Google account information
4. **Fallback Authentication** - Maintain email/password option for users without Google accounts

**User Flows:**
1. **New User Google Sign-In**: Click Google button → OAuth consent → Profile creation → Dashboard
2. **Existing User Linking**: Settings → Link Google Account → OAuth consent → Confirmation
3. **Return User**: Click Google button → Dashboard (auto-login)

## Non-Functional Requirements

**Security:**
- OAuth 2.0 compliance with PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange)
- Secure token storage and refresh mechanisms
- User consent management and privacy compliance

**Performance:**
- Authentication flow completion under 3 seconds
- No impact on existing application performance
- Graceful fallback if Google services unavailable

**Usability:**
- Clear authentication options presentation
- Intuitive error handling and messaging
- Consistent with existing application design

## Out of Scope

**Explicitly Excluded:**
- Integration with other social providers (Facebook, LinkedIn, GitHub) in initial release
- Single Sign-On (SSO) for enterprise customers
- Migration of existing user base to Google-only authentication
- Advanced account management features (account merging, multiple linked accounts)

**Future Considerations:**
- Multi-provider social authentication
- Enterprise SSO integration
- Enhanced profile synchronization with Google Workspace

## Success Criteria

**Launch Criteria:**
- [ ] Google authentication flow functional for new users
- [ ] Account linking available for existing users
- [ ] Security audit completed with no critical findings
- [ ] Performance impact assessment shows <100ms additional latency
- [ ] User acceptance testing shows 85%+ satisfaction rate

**Business Success Indicators:**
- 70% of new registrations use Google authentication within first month
- 25% improvement in visitor-to-user conversion rate
- 60% reduction in authentication-related support tickets
- Maintenance of existing user satisfaction scores (no degradation)

## Assumptions and Constraints

**Technical Assumptions:**
- Google Cloud Console project setup and OAuth credentials available
- Django-allauth or similar library integration feasible
- Frontend React components can integrate Google Sign-In JavaScript SDK
- Current JWT authentication system can coexist with OAuth tokens

**Business Constraints:**
- Must maintain backward compatibility with existing user accounts
- Implementation timeline: 4 weeks maximum
- No additional third-party service costs exceeding $50/month
- Must comply with GDPR and privacy regulations

**Dependencies:**
- Google Cloud Console access for OAuth app registration
- SSL certificates for production OAuth callbacks
- Privacy policy and terms of service updates
- User communication for feature rollout

## Risk Assessment

**Technical Risks:**
- OAuth integration complexity causing development delays (Medium)
- Token management conflicts with existing JWT system (Low)
- Google API rate limiting or service availability (Low)

**Business Risks:**
- User confusion with multiple authentication methods (Medium)
- Privacy concerns about Google integration (Low)
- Existing user resistance to account linking (Low)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Phased rollout starting with new users only
- Clear user communication about benefits and privacy
- Comprehensive testing in staging environment
- Fallback authentication maintenance
