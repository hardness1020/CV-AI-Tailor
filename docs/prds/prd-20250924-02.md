# PRD: Artifact Editing Functionality

**Document ID:** PRD-20250924-02
**Date:** 2024-09-24
**Status:** Draft
**Author:** Claude Code

## Problem Statement

**Current State:** Users can upload and create artifacts in the CV Tailor system, but once artifacts are uploaded, they cannot modify the content, metadata, or associated evidence links. This creates friction when users need to update their work samples, correct information, or add additional context.

**Business Problem:**
1. **Data Accuracy** - Users cannot correct mistakes or outdated information in their artifacts
2. **Content Evolution** - Work samples and projects evolve over time, requiring updates to descriptions, technologies, and evidence
3. **User Frustration** - Users must delete and re-upload entire artifacts for minor changes
4. **Portfolio Maintenance** - Professional portfolios require regular updates to remain current and accurate

## Target Users

**Primary Users:**
- **Active Professionals** - Users who regularly update their work samples and project descriptions
- **Career Progressors** - Individuals whose roles and responsibilities evolve, requiring artifact updates
- **Project Maintainers** - Users with ongoing projects that require regular documentation updates

**User Personas:**
- **"Evolving Engineer Sarah"** - Software developer whose projects gain new features and technologies over time
- **"Detail-Oriented Mike"** - Quality-focused professional who spots errors and wants to maintain accurate records
- **"Portfolio Manager Jennifer"** - Consultant who regularly updates project outcomes and client feedback

## Business Objectives

**Primary Objectives:**
1. **Improve User Retention** by providing comprehensive artifact management capabilities
2. **Increase Data Quality** through easy correction and update mechanisms
3. **Enhance User Experience** by reducing friction in portfolio maintenance
4. **Support Professional Growth** by enabling users to showcase evolving expertise

**Success Metrics:**
- **User Engagement**: 40% of users edit artifacts within 30 days of creation
- **Data Accuracy**: 25% reduction in duplicate artifacts (users re-uploading instead of editing)
- **User Satisfaction**: 90%+ satisfaction with artifact management features
- **Feature Adoption**: 70% of active users use edit functionality within first month

## Functional Requirements

**Core Editing Capabilities:**
1. **Metadata Editing** - Modify title, description, dates, type, technologies, collaborators
2. **Evidence Management** - Add, remove, and edit evidence links and uploaded files
3. **Content Validation** - Ensure data integrity during editing operations
4. **Version History** - Track changes for audit and rollback capabilities (future consideration)

**User Flows:**
1. **Quick Edit**: Artifact list → Edit button → Inline form → Save
2. **Detailed Edit**: Artifact detail → Edit mode → Full form → Save with validation
3. **Evidence Management**: Artifact detail → Manage evidence → Add/remove/edit → Save

## Technical Requirements

**Backend Requirements:**
- RESTful API endpoints for artifact updates (PUT/PATCH operations)
- Validation of edited data including file type checking and URL validation
- Atomic transactions for complex updates involving multiple related objects
- Proper error handling and user feedback for validation failures

**Frontend Requirements:**
- Intuitive editing interface with form validation and real-time feedback
- File upload/replacement functionality with progress indicators
- Optimistic updates with rollback capability on errors
- Responsive design for mobile artifact editing

**Data Integrity:**
- Foreign key constraint preservation during updates
- File cleanup for replaced/removed evidence
- Concurrent edit detection and conflict resolution
- Data validation matching creation-time rules

## User Stories

### Primary User Stories

**US-001: Edit Artifact Metadata**
```
As a user with uploaded artifacts
I want to edit the title, description, dates, and technologies
So that I can keep my portfolio information current and accurate
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Can modify all artifact metadata fields (title, description, type, dates, technologies, collaborators)
- [ ] Form validation prevents invalid data (empty required fields, invalid dates, etc.)
- [ ] Changes are saved atomically - all succeed or all fail
- [ ] User receives confirmation of successful updates
- [ ] Error messages are clear and actionable for validation failures

**US-002: Manage Evidence Links**
```
As a user maintaining my artifacts
I want to add, edit, and remove evidence links
So that I can keep my supporting documentation up-to-date
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Can add new evidence links with URL validation
- [ ] Can edit existing evidence link URLs and descriptions
- [ ] Can remove evidence links with confirmation
- [ ] URL validation provides immediate feedback
- [ ] Link types can be changed (GitHub, website, document, etc.)

**US-003: Replace and Manage Files**
```
As a user with uploaded documents
I want to replace files or add new files to existing artifacts
So that I can update my work samples without recreating artifacts
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Can upload additional files to existing artifacts
- [ ] Can replace existing files while maintaining metadata
- [ ] File type validation matches creation requirements
- [ ] Old files are properly cleaned up when replaced
- [ ] File size limits are enforced consistently

**US-004: Bulk Edit Operations**
```
As a user managing multiple artifacts
I want to edit multiple artifacts efficiently
So that I can make batch updates like adding new technologies across projects
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Can select multiple artifacts for batch operations
- [ ] Can add technologies to multiple artifacts simultaneously
- [ ] Can update artifact types in bulk
- [ ] Batch operations provide progress feedback
- [ ] Individual failures don't prevent other updates from succeeding

## Non-Functional Requirements

**Performance:**
- Edit operations complete within 2 seconds for metadata changes
- File uploads show progress and complete within reasonable time based on file size
- UI remains responsive during editing operations with loading states

**Usability:**
- Editing interface is discoverable and intuitive
- Form validation provides immediate feedback
- Users can cancel edits and return to previous state
- Clear visual distinction between view and edit modes

**Reliability:**
- Concurrent edits are handled gracefully with conflict detection
- Data consistency maintained during partial update failures
- File operations are atomic (upload succeeds or fails completely)

## Security and Privacy

**Access Control:**
- Users can only edit their own artifacts
- Authentication required for all edit operations
- Proper permission checking at API level

**Data Validation:**
- Server-side validation for all user inputs
- File type and size validation consistent with upload rules
- URL validation for evidence links
- Sanitization of user-provided text content

## Technical Architecture

**API Endpoints:**
- `PUT /api/artifacts/{id}/` - Full artifact update
- `PATCH /api/artifacts/{id}/` - Partial artifact update
- `POST /api/artifacts/{id}/evidence-links/` - Add evidence link
- `PUT /api/artifacts/{id}/evidence-links/{link_id}/` - Update evidence link
- `DELETE /api/artifacts/{id}/evidence-links/{link_id}/` - Remove evidence link
- `POST /api/artifacts/{id}/files/` - Add files to artifact
- `DELETE /api/artifacts/{id}/files/{file_id}/` - Remove file

**Data Flow:**
1. User initiates edit from UI
2. Frontend loads current artifact data
3. User modifies data in edit form
4. Frontend validates changes client-side
5. API call with updated data
6. Backend validates and updates database
7. Response confirms success/failure
8. UI updates to reflect changes

## Out of Scope

**Initial Release Exclusions:**
- Version history and change tracking (future enhancement)
