# PRD — CV & Cover-Letter Auto-Tailor (with Evidence)

**Version:** v1.0.0
**File:** docs/prds/prd-20250923.md
**Owners:** Product (TBD), Engineering (TBD)
**Last_updated:** 2025-09-23

## Summary

Upload your work once with proof. For any job description + company, the app assembles a targeted, ATS-friendly CV and cover letter with quantified, defensible achievement bullets—grounded by linked evidence. Targeting job seekers from students to senior engineers/PMs/DS who need credible, consistent, reusable career documents.

## Problem & Context

**Problem:** Tailoring CVs is slow, error-prone, and often unsubstantiated. Job seekers repeat vague claims that don't map tightly to job descriptions and fail automated ATS screens, leading to missed opportunities and prolonged job searches.

**Why now:** LLMs can parse job descriptions, map skills, and write strong bullets—but they need trusted, structured inputs and verifiable evidence to produce credible, consistent outputs that pass both ATS systems and human review.

**Evidence:** Manual CV tailoring takes 2-4 hours per application; 75% of resumes are filtered by ATS before human review; unsubstantiated claims reduce credibility with hiring managers.

## Users & Use Cases

**Primary persona:** Job seekers (student → senior engineer/PM/DS) actively applying for roles

**Key jobs-to-be-done:**
1. "Show me the best version of my CV for this role at this company, grounded in my real work"
2. "Draft a concise, specific cover letter that cites relevant proof"
3. "Keep versions for different roles without duplicating effort"
4. "Ensure my application passes ATS screening with proper keywords"
5. "Provide verifiable evidence for my achievements when requested"

## Scope (MoSCoW)

**Must:**
- Artifact ingestion (repos, papers, talks, datasets, dashboards, PRDs)
- Evidence linking (GitHub PRs, live apps, arXiv, demo videos)
- Role-based labeling system with skill taxonomy
- Job description parsing and matching engine
- ATS-optimized CV generation with keyword preservation
- Cover letter generation with evidence citations
- PDF/Docx export with clean formatting
- Version tracking and evidence link management

**Should:**
- QR code/footnote evidence linking in exports
- Reusable label templates for role families
- STAR/CAR achievement framework integration
- Company-specific customization signals
- Browser extension for job posting ingestion

**Could:**
- Team/collaborative workspace features
- Interview preparation based on submitted evidence
- Performance analytics and application tracking
- Integration with job boards and LinkedIn

**Won't:**
- Social media profile optimization (future PRD)
- Salary negotiation tools (future PRD)
- Background check preparation (future PRD)

## Success Metrics

**Primary:**
- Time to create tailored CV+cover letter: baseline 3 hours → target 15 minutes (90% reduction by 2025-12-31)
- ATS pass rate: baseline 25% → target 65% (40pp improvement by 2025-12-31)
- User retention: 70% monthly active users after 3 months

**Guardrails:**
- Evidence link accuracy ≥95% (verified working links)
- Generated content relevance score ≥8/10 (user-rated)
- Export formatting quality ≥95% ATS compatibility
- Response time ≤30 seconds for CV generation

## Non-Goals

This PRD explicitly excludes:
- Real-time collaboration features (v1)
- Advanced analytics dashboard (v1)
- Interview scheduling or tracking
- Salary benchmarking or negotiation
- Background verification services
- Social media optimization beyond LinkedIn basics

## Requirements

### Functional
- As a job seeker, I upload my projects/work history with supporting evidence links
- As a job seeker, I paste a job description and get a relevance-ranked CV within 30 seconds
- As a job seeker, I receive a cover letter that specifically cites 2-3 pieces of evidence
- As a job seeker, I can export clean PDF/Docx that passes ATS parsing
- As a job seeker, I can track which evidence was included in each application version
- As a job seeker, I can reuse role labels for similar positions without re-uploading

### Non-Functional
- **Availability:** ≥99.5% uptime during business hours
- **Performance:** CV generation ≤30s, evidence verification ≤10s
- **Security:** Evidence links encrypted at rest, no credential storage
- **Privacy:** User data isolated, GDPR/CCPA compliant deletion
- **Scalability:** Support 10,000 concurrent users, 1M+ artifacts stored

## Dependencies

**Data:**
- Skills taxonomy database (O*NET, LinkedIn Skills)
- ATS parsing validation dataset
- Company information database

**Services:**
- LLM API access (OpenAI/Anthropic) for content generation
- Document parsing service (PDF/Docx)
- URL validation and metadata extraction
- Email/authentication service

**Legal/Policy:**
- Privacy policy review for evidence link handling
- Terms of service for generated content liability
- GDPR compliance review for EU users

**3rd-party:**
- GitHub API for repository metadata
- LinkedIn API for profile enhancement (future)
- Job board APIs for posting ingestion (future)

## Risks & Mitigations

**Top risks:**
1. **LLM hallucination/inaccuracy** → Detection: Human review loops, confidence scoring; Fallback: Template-based generation
2. **Evidence link degradation** → Detection: Automated link checking; Fallback: Link validation warnings, archive.org fallbacks
3. **ATS compatibility issues** → Detection: Test suite against major ATS systems; Fallback: Multiple export format options
4. **User data privacy concerns** → Detection: Security audits, penetration testing; Fallback: Enhanced encryption, data minimization
