## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18 or higher
- npm or yarn package manager

### Installation

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open your browser and visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### Development Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint
- `npm run typecheck` - Run TypeScript type checking
- `npm test` - Run tests with Vitest

## API Integration

The frontend communicates with the Django backend API at `/api/`. The API client is configured to:

- Automatically attach JWT tokens to requests
- Handle token refresh on expiration
- Show user-friendly error messages
- Retry failed requests with exponential backoff

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file for local development:

```env
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000
VITE_SENTRY_DSN=your_sentry_dsn
VITE_GA_ID=your_google_analytics_id
```

## Component Guidelines

### Naming Conventions

- Use PascalCase for component names
- Use camelCase for props and functions
- Use kebab-case for CSS classes

### File Organization

- Each component should have its own file
- Related components can be grouped in subdirectories
- Export components as default exports

### State Management

- Use Zustand stores for global state
- Keep local state in components when possible
- Use React Query for server state management

### Styling

- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes
- Create reusable component variants with `cn()` utility
- Follow the design system color palette
